# PigCore Game Prototype
This project was set up to test and validate the folder/file structure for a video game project based on [PigCore](https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/PigCore)

## Goals
1. We want the core repository to live entirely inside the `core/` folder. I like the idea that the core layers are a tool, not a framework, so rather than the game repository living inside the core folder structure, the core folder structure lives inside the game repository.
2. Figure out how much we want to be able to enable/disble from build_config.h. Between games we may want to use different third_party libraries or frameworks but within a single game we don't really need a quick way to switch off these frameworks so the assumption should be baked into the build.bat.
3. Is there a sensible way to share some code between the PigCore build.bat/build_config.h and the game's build.bat/build_config.h? It's possible the answer is no and we'll just commit to copying the PigCore build.bat (or a previous project) whenever we make a new game, and we maintain each build.bat for each project separately.
4. Figure out how resources should be managed so that the game can be easily run after building and have access to all the resources as if it was a packaged/shipped build. Since PigCore may have some resources that it relies on, we may need some way to automatically pull those resources out of the core folder and into our `_data` folder. Or maybe we need the game to handle checking two folders for it's resources?
